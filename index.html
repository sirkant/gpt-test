# Welcome to My Personal Website!
Welcome to my personal website! I'm so glad you're here! This website will be a hub of information about me and my interests. It will include any projects I have worked on, my CV, my skills, and more. 

## About Me
I'm a passionate software developer and engineer from the USA. I'm currently studying Computer Science at a university and my goal is to create amazing applications that will help push technology and innoviation forward. I'm also interested in game development, robotics and exploring new technologies. 

## My Projects
I love to work on and explore a variety of projects. Here's a list of some of my favorite projects: 

- An interactive web app that helps people create business plans
- A 2D platformer game
- A web scraper to help people find the best deals
- An IoT device that tracks air pollution levels

## Getting Started
The code in the repository should help you set up the website on your local machine. 

To begin, clone or download the repository to your local machine. Be sure to run `npm install` to download any relevant dependencies. 

Once dependencies are installed, you should be able to run the website on your local machine via a local server. If you're using a Node.js server, you can run `node index.js` from the command line.

## That's All!
Thank you for taking the time to check out my website! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me at yourname@example.com.
